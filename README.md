-------------------User-------------------

Potential use cases for this software: managers, company analysts 
and executives for the retail company that operates whatever retail store
monitored by this application. We target an audience that can make decisions
while having access to data of purchases, product stock, and users. Can also
be good for small business owners who have limited resources.
